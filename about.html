                    I grew up in a town in a state where every blink of eye reveal's people. I do not know what would
                    describe me since I am still on my way to discover my purpose. Here's a little story of how I fell
                    in love with computer's.
                    It was summer of 2006 and I was still in my early years trying to understand this world. As every
                    kid I was intrigued by
                    the flashing lights vibrant colours of toys. I was lucky enough to be able to get a computer in our
                    house back then in 2006 since our
                    dad always made sure we got the best of everything. As far I could recall, I saw my sister as she
                    moved a very strange object and
                    suddenly a white square moved on the screen moved. I was fascinated and intrigued by this very
                    moment in time and at that age
                    I could only wonder what other worldly magic was done to make it move. Fast forward a couple of
                    years to now, I am building tools for
                    the web which will enable more decentralization and would a step towards equality among every
                    individual on this planet.<br>
