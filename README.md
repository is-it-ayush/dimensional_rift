### Dimensional Rift
The **Dimensional Rift** is a portfolio project created by me back in April 2022. The source was almost lost since I didn't knew github back then. However, _**the main goal** was to create a beautiful design with custom shaders._ It was my first attempt at creating something in **webgl**. I'm not sure if I'll ever continue this project, but I'm glad I have been able to recover the source code back again.
